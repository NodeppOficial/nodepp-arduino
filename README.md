# Nodepp-Arduino

**Nodepp** is an innovative open source project that aims to make it easier to create applications in **C++**. This project introduces a high-level abstraction layer that allows developers to write **C++** code in a way that is similar to how they would write code in **NodeJS**. With **Nodepp**, developers can leverage the advantages of the **C++** language while benefiting from the ease of use and flexibility that **NodeJS** offers. This unique combination of features makes **Nodepp** a powerful tool for creating high-performance and scalable applications. Additionally, since it is an open source project, anyone can contribute and improve **Nodepp** to fit their specific needs.

## Features

- 📌: Allows writing **C++** code as if writing in **NodeJS** or **Javascript**
- 📌: Adds a high-level abstraction layer to simplify **C++** application development
- 📌: Compatible with several platforms like Arduino UNO | Esp8266 | Esp32 | Stm32 Compatible
- 📌: Supports **Coroutines**, which allows running multiple tasks concurrently on a single thread

## Bateries Included

- 📌: Include a **build-in JSON** parser / stringify system.
- 📌: Include a **build-in RegExp** engine for processing text strings.
- 📌: Include a **build-in System** that make every object **Async Task** safety.
- 📌: Include a **Smart Pointer** base **Garbage Collector** to avoid **Memory Leaks**.
- 📌: Include support for **Reactive Programming** based on **Events** and **Observers**.
- 📌: Include an **Event Loop** that can handle multiple events and tasks on a single thread.

## Hello world
```cpp
#include <nodepp.h>

using namespace nodepp;

void onMain() {
    console::log("Hello World!");
}
```
